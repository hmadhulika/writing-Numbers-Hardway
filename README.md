## Writing Numbers the Hard Way

In an effort to be as difficult for a reader, you decide that from now on you will write all the numbers using a fraction with the smallest possible positive denominator for the decimal portion of the number. 

For example, for a number that is 23.87 you want the out put like 23 7/8.

Note that any fraction of a number that you write will be rounded down to the nearest decimal number, meaning that multiple fractions exist that will round down to the same number of decimal (e.g. both 1/51 and 1/100 round down to 0.01).

Our goal is to be make it difficult for readers, you should always use the fraction with the smallest possible positive denominator.

## Running the tests

0.01 => 1/51
0.02 => 1/34
0.03 => 1/26
0.04 => 1/21
0.05 => 1/17
0.06 => 1/15
0.07 => 1/13
0.08 => 1/12
0.09 => 1/11
0.10 => 1/10
0.11 => 1/9
0.12 => 1/8
0.13 => 2/15
